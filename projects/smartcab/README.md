#MLND Slack Team Walkthrough.

We have seen in our experience, that many students struggle with this project, largely due to the code.
This fork of the standard P4, is made to help you understand some of the complicated code used in P4.  Please review the code, add your comments and understanding.

The ideal situation here is to combine our knowledge and explanation of of what's going in the code.
Everyone is welcome to contribute, please use the pull request system.

#### Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

Template code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the `LearningAgent` class in `agent.py` when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
